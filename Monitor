Uptime monitors (open beta) continuously check the availability of a single API endpoint, website, or other URL and let you know whenever downtime occurs (typically within 1 to 2 minutes).

To create a new uptime monitor, simply enter the URL and select which team members should be notified of a system outage. You can customize how often the monitor checks the availability of the URL. You can also configure the monitor to run in multiple regions (paid plans only).

Use the uptime monitor dashboard to quickly check if the API endpoint is currently up or down and the average response time. You can also view previous downtime incidents and get insights into the availability of the endpoint over time.
